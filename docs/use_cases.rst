    control systems intrusions.

    **Use Case** 

    "I want to ensure I have complete visibility of an active security incident."

    Use the mappings to take the observed adversary behaviors as described in ATT&CK to understand current visibility of potential suspicious activities and tie in actionable intelligence from CTI reporting.

    out information security policies, procedures, and controls, and providing primary
    interface between senior managers and information system owners.

    **Use Case**

    access and attacks.

    **Use Case**
