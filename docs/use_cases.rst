Usage
-----

Understanding Current Visibility​
SOCs can understand which techniques they have visibility into given their current set of tools and capabilities. ​

Filling Defensive Gaps – analytics, tools, etc.​
SOCs can understand what tools and capabilities to acquire or enable in order to fill gaps.  ​

Finding Threats​
SOCs can understand which of their tools and capabilities to look in for specific techniques used by adversaries.​

User Stories
------------

Defenders performing essential capabilities can use these mapping to support a variety of use cases, such as: 

1. As an Incident Responder, I want to ensure I have complete visibility of an active security incident.  

    Use the mappings to take the observed adversary behaviors as described in ATT&CK to understand current 
    visibility of potential suspicious activities and tie in actionable intelligence from CTI reporting. 

2. As a Chief Information Security Officer or Information System Security Officer (CISO or ISSO), I need to 
   align defensive posture with the real-world threats targeting my industry.  

    Use the mappings to understand which of tools and capabilities provide visibility into specific real-world 
    adversary techniques and where gaps may lie. 

3. As a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, I need visibility into threats launched against my organization.  

    Use the mappings for identified Data Sources associated with adversary techniques used to identify areas to 
    look for additional indicators of potential suspicious activities. 

4. As a Security Engineer, I want to detect entire classes of adversarial behavior.  

    Build in defensive countermeasures for specific adversary TTPs, using the mappings to identify areas and 
    fill in defensive coverage gaps by reconfiguring existing or adding additional tools or capabilities.
