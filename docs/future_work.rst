Future Work 
===========

Sensor Mappings to ATT&CK project can be used as the foundational basis for other areas of research, 
such as: 

- Event ID mappings to ATT&CK Techniques 
- Event ID mappings to Vendor Sensors
- Additional Sensors within the Windows, Linux, MacOS, Network, and Cloud platform

If you have any thoughts to future areas of research, please submit a `GitHub Issue <https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/sensor-mappings-to-attack/issues>`_
