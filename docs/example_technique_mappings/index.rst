Overview
--------

Examples are provided to depict how these mappings can be used to get from Sensor Events to Data Sources to Techniques. 
It should be stated up front that there is no easy, one-to-one mapping from data source to technique. In addition, 
not all events are created equal in regard to visibility of specific techniques, and two events with the same field 
names can in fact represent different data. Some amount of analyst judgement is required and, whenever judgement is 
involved, there can be differences in opinion. The mapping methodology and these examples are provided to demonstrate 
the judgement and rationale to apply when identifying specific event visibility into techniques.
