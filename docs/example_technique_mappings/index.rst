Overview
--------

Examples are provided to depict how these mappings can be used to get from Sensor Events to ATT&CK Data Sources to 
ATT&CK Techniques. It should be stated up front that there is no easy, one-to-one mapping from data source to technique. 
In addition, not all events are created equal in regard to visibility of specific techniques, and two events with the 
same field names can in fact represent different data. Some amount of analyst judgement is required and, whenever 
judgement is involved, there can be differences in opinion. The mapping methodology and these examples are provided to 
demonstrate the judgement and rationale to apply when identifying specific event visibility into techniques. Of course, 
additonal customized considerations must also be given when looking to provide insight into a specific environment.
