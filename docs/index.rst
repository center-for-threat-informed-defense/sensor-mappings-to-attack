Sensor Mappings to ATT&CK
=========================

The Sensor Mappings to ATT&CK Project (SMAP) is a collection of resources to assist
security operations teams and security leaders with understanding which tools,
capabilities, and events can help provide visibility into real-world adversary behaviors
potentially occurring in their environments. SMAP builds on `MITRE ATT&CK®
<https://attack.mitre.org/>`_ Data Sources by connecting the conceptual data source
representions of information that can be collected to concrete logs, sensors, and other
security capabilities that provide that type of data.

This project is created and maintained by `MITRE Center for Threat-Informed
Defense (Center) <https://ctid.mitre.org>`_ and is funded by our `research
participants
<https://ctid.mitre.org/projects/sensor-mappings-to-attack#participants-section>`_,
in futherance of our mission to advance the start of the art and the state of the
practice in threat-informed defense globally. This work complements the Center's
`Security Stack Mappings
<https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/security-stack-mappings>`_
project by allowing defenders to use both resources to understand their overall
defensive coverage and make threat-informed decisions.
