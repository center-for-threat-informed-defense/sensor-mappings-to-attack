Sensor Mappings to ATT&CK
=========================

Sensor Mappings to ATT&CK (SMTA) is a collection of resources to assist security operations teams 
and security leaders understand which tools, capabilities, and events can help detect real-world 
adversary TTPs in their environments. SMTA builds on `MITRE ATT&CK® <https://attack.mitre.org/>`_ Data Sources 
by connecting the conceptual data source representions of information that can be collected to concrete 
logs, sensors, and other security capabilities that provide that type of data.   


This project is created and maintained by `MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense 
(Center) <https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/>`_ and is funded by our `research participants <https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/our-work/>`_, in futherance of our mission to 
advance the start of the art and the state of the practice in threat-informed defense globally. 
This work complements the Center's `Security Stack Mappings <https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/security-stack-mappings>`_ project by 
allowing defenders to use both resources to understand their overall defensive coverage and make 
threat-informed decisions.
