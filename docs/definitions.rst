MITRE ATT&CK 
------------
MITRE ATT&CKÂ® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. ATT&CK focuses on how external adversaries compromise and operate within computer information networks.

Techniques 
~~~~~~~~~~
Techniques represent "how" - the means by which adversaries achieve tactical objective.

Sub-techniques
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sub-techniques break down behaviors described by techniques into more specific means by which adversaries achieve tactical objectives.

Data Source 
~~~~~~~~~~~
Data Sources represent information collected by a sensor or logging system that may identify properties or values relevant to identifying the adversarial action being performed, sequence of actions, or the results of those actions.

Data Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Data Components are  constituent pieces of the data source, which are best described separately. Components may have their own set of metadata (describing the associated fields/values associated with the source) and activities (describing actions of the source).

ATT&CK Data Sources and Data Components can be found `here <https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/>`_.

Data Elements
-------------
Data elements are names, definitions, and attributes that are being used or captured in an event

Sensors
-------
A sensor is an agent or service capable of detecting or measuring information across many different sources on a host in real-time. Sensors provide raw data with high precision and accuracy.

Telemetry/Events
----------------
Telemetry/events are generated by sensors in the form of log data, automatically generated and transmitted or streamed in near real-time, regardless of the format (e.g., json, csv, etc.).
