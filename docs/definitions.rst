Definitions
===========

This page defines the key terms used throughout our research.

Data Component
   Data Components are constituent pieces of the data source, which are best described
   separately. Components may have their own set of metadata (describing the associated
   fields/values associated with the source) and activities (describing actions of the
   source). ATT&CK Data Sources and Data Components can be found `here
   <https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/>`__.

Data Elements
   Data Elements are names, definitions, and attributes that are being used or captured
   in an event.

Data Source
   Data Sources represents information collected by a sensor or logging system that may
   identify properties or values relevant to identifying the adversarial action being
   ATT&CK Data Sources and Data Components can be found `here
   <https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/>`__. performed, sequence of actions, or the
   results of those actions.

MITRE ATT&CK
   MITRE ATT&CKÂ® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and
   techniques based on real-world observations. ATT&CK focuses on how external
   adversaries compromise and operate within computer networks.

Sensor
   A sensor is an agent or service capable of detecting or measuring information across
   many different sources on a host or network in real-time. Sensors provide raw data
   with high precision and accuracy.

[Sub-]Technique
   Techniques represent the "how" of cyber intrusions, i.e. the means by which
   adversaries achieve tactical objective. Sub-techniques break down techniques into
   more fine-grained descriptions of adversary behaviors.

Telemetry
   Telemetry consists of discrete events that are generated by sensors, e.g. log data.
   Telemetry may be delivered in various formats (e.g., json, csv, etc.) and is often
   streamed in near real-time.
